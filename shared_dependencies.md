1. Dependencies: All files will share the following dependencies: python-telegram-bot, OpenAI GPT API, SQLAlchemy (for database operations), and Flask (for web server operations).

2. Exported Variables: The "config.py" file will export configuration variables such as TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY, and DATABASE_URI which will be used across "main.py", "bot_handlers.py", "ai_module.py", and "database_module.py".

3. Data Schemas: The "models/user.py" and "models/test_results.py" will define the User and TestResults data schemas respectively. These schemas will be used in "database_module.py" for database operations and in "bot_handlers.py" for processing user messages and test results.

4. Function Names: Functions like handle_message(), process_test_results(), and provide_health_advice() in "bot_handlers.py" will be used in "main.py". The "ai_module.py" will have functions like generate_advice() which will be used in "bot_handlers.py". The "database_module.py" will have functions like add_user(), add_test_result(), get_user(), and get_test_results() which will be used in "bot_handlers.py".

5. Message Names: The "bot_handlers.py" will use message names like START, HELP, ADD_TEST_RESULT, and CONSULT which will be used to trigger corresponding bot actions.

6. User and TestResults IDs: The User and TestResults data schemas will have id fields which will be used in "database_module.py" for database operations and in "bot_handlers.py" for processing user messages and test results.

7. Utils: The "utils.py" file will contain utility functions that can be used across all other files. For example, it might contain a function to validate test results before they are added to the database.
